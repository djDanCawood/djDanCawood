- 👋 Hi, I’m @djDanCawood, I'm not a dj that was an identifier that I added without thinking about the consequences
- 👀 I’m interested in getting back into programming. I started when I was 8 ... a long time ago learning Basic on a VIC20 with 3.5 Kb
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, when I first started my IT career I was working in a CPP development house and started learning, but I went down the management route and stopped using code and forgot what I learnt. I've since been taught Java on three seperate occasions spanning JDK 1.1 to Java 8, again as a manager I never use it so it falls quickly into disrepair, I taught myself Pyhton during lockdown.  I find my interest in C++ piqued again as I started to build some robot hardware with my son, using micro python, but got frustrated how far apart the code and the tin is, so many years later I decided to pick up where I left of in the late 90's...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on . Given my newbie status I would be afraid to colloborate on anything right now! I'm going through some UDEMY course material then I fancy tackling some of the One Lone Coders projects as I love his channel.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'll be in a dark corner until my confidence grows...
